Welcome to Toms Image Uploader, the shitty app to upload you images to imgur.

How to use:
	
	Run the app through the command line giving the directory to a single image.
	
	For example:
		python Main.py C:/testImage.png
		
	Alternatively you can drag and drop single images onto the script and let the OS
	do the heavy lifting for you.
	
	Once the image has been uploaded the corresponding link will be placed in your clipboard
	ready to paste to your friends.
	
	Obviously you need python to run this...
